ALPHA RESTful server for Argent project
Demo implementation
=================================

How to compile:

* Make sure you have GO version 1.8.3+
* Only usable on Gentoo-based distros, for now.

git clone https://github.com/StefanCristian/poc-rest

* Set GOPATH=<path/to/the/cloned/folder/poc-rest>
* Set GOROOT to where golang is installed!
* Get into folder called poc-rest/src and:

go get -u gitlab.com/stefancristian/mux

go build

=================================

How to use:

Once started the server, the only functions it will take right now are:
- Getting all available commands with "GET" on port 8003 ( which cannot be changed )
- POST request on http://<IP>:8003/installation/install_pkg with a json body as:
{ "emerge" : "<any-package-name>" }
The POST request on that specific link will trigger the installation of any package
you parse it to. It takes only known packages, search function is not implemented yet
- Getting a demo function installation through POST request on http://<IP>:8003/installation
This POST request will install the demo package named "argent-skel", it can be changed only
from the code right now, to have an idea what's about to happen in the future.
- Getting all available commands by using "GET" method on http://<IP>:8003/allcommands
The link, if using "GET", will show-up all the available command which were setup in
gentoo_commands.json through the standard json format ( "emerge" : "emerge" )

==================================

To be implemented:

* Code refactoring, making things more dynamic
* Full search using GET through Gentoo Portage package manager
* More dynamic configuration of the REST server
* Database support
* Logging support
* Service management through systemctl / openRC
